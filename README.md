# Unity Meme Bingo
-Abby Chen & Sophie Debs for CS98 hack-a-thing-2

### What we did

We created randomly generated bingo cards in Unity. Instead of the typical B-12, I-25 fare the player can create meme bingo cards (which are memes in themselves - memeception!) A glance at the many varieties on meme bingo online:

Our pictured example is YA novel tropes bingo.

Who did what:
Abby set up the assets and stripped the extraneous capabilities.
Sophie added the reset button.
We worked together to convert the bingo numbers to insertable text, randomize it, and generate some content.


### What we learned

* C# is really similar to Java.
* Unity has a combination of coding and drag and drop interfaces that can get confusing at times.
* Visual Studio Code is your BFF.
* Adding and removing capabilities from assets can be really complicated, especially if the code base is messy.

### Inspiration for future projects

* Game ideas can be fun to implement.
* Unity is pretty cool!

### What didn't work
* There are options for 1-4 bingo cards but our current format is only optimized for 2 cards at the moment.
